## Berd air pump

A mount, tool receiver and various shapes of nozzles for a Berd air setup. The pump is mounted to the frame with the air tube running to the tool carriage and into a manifold. Each tool has a pipe which docks with the manifold, routing air to the nozzle.
The primary drivers for the design are

* A single pump to drive `n` tools
* Even cooling from every side
* Retain height adjustability
* Modular nozzle design to allow for various tool heights (eg a standard v6 vs a Volcano)
